# Stretch - reach higher, connect deeper!
Our idea is to create a virtual character (sprite) of the atendee to assign points, give rankings, and build up event anticipaion.

⋅⋅*Point-based reward system explained

Purpose: to keep atendees engaged.

Every time the person shows up to an event, they gain a number of points.

The point system are used in a number of things:

⋅⋅*Give ranks that will be displayed on that person's profile and can be visible to other people - gives the incentive to maintain a certain status. Aditionally, being in a specific status group gives you access to aditional perks, like afterparties, or freebies.
⋅⋅* Reedem the points for additional perks: free coffe in the area of the event, discounts on the travel to/from the event.
⋅⋅*The points influence your giraffe's neck lenght: if you miss the event without prior cancelling, the points get deducted, the neck gets shorter to the point that the giraffe looks dismorphed. 

Giraff's acting like an emotional support animal. 

At certain times before the event (2-weeks, 1-week, 3 days, 1 day), the giraff's checking in with the atendee to see how they're feeling. The atendees choose the appropriate emoji and then based on answers, giraffe's giving feedback. 
Examples of feedback:
Anxious: "Even I get wobbly knees sometimes. Want to try some deep breaths together? Inhale… exhale… Ahh, much better!"
Excited: "Woo-hoo! Your excitement is like a tall tree full of the juiciest leaves—absolutely delightful!"
Unsure: "It’s okay to have mixed feelings! If you need help deciding, I’m all ears (and a long neck to see ahead)!"

Buddy-up system (neck&neck) explained:

Purpose: to help newcomers / people to with anxiety to connect prior to the event.

The buddying is possible after registering to an event.

⋅⋅* The person chooses to show themselves as "Ready to stick my neck out" (similar to linkedin "Open to work") to make other aware that they're looking to buddy up and also make it easier to look out for "buddies".
⋅⋅* When you are open to "buddy up", you have access to reach out to the other person to come to the event together, which reduces the anxiety to enter the room full of people by themselves.
⋅⋅* Buddies are able to create a "herd" (a group) to be able to arrange a meeting near the venue to get to know each other before the event.
⋅⋅*The system suggest "best buddies" based on the interests (previous events that they attended) to find a best match.
